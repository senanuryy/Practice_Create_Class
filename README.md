# Practice_Create_Class
This is a simple C# console application for managing basic information about students and teachers. The project demonstrates how to create classes, use properties, and work with basic methods like printing data to the console.

## How It Works

1. **Person Class**  
   The `Person` class contains the following properties:
   - `Student` (bool): Indicates whether the person is a student or a teacher.
   - `Name` (string): The person's first name.
   - `Surname` (string): The person's last name.
   - `BirthDate` (DateTime): The person's date of birth.

2. **Introduce Method**  
   The `Introduce` method prints personalized information depending on whether the person is a student or a teacher.

3. **Main Method**  
   - Creates instances of `Person` class representing students and teachers.
   - Calls the `Introduce` method to print the details of each person.
